VGlut1-IRES2-Cre-D mice crossed to Ai162D (Jackson Laboratory: 031562 and 023527) generated double heterozygous mice
expressing GCaMP6s in pyramidal cells. After postnatal day 60, a custom titanium headplate was implanted and a 3mm
craniotomy and durotomy, centered over primary visual cortex, was performed. The imaging window was comprised of 3mm
and 4mm circular coverslips glued together, whereby the 3mm coverslip would make contact with the cortical surface and
the 4mm rim would be cemented to the cranium. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy was performed approximately 200um
below the cortical surface at an acquisition rate of 10.2 frames per second with a 920nm femtosecond laser (Coherent).
Visual stimuli consisted of eight drifting gratings (0.035 cycles/Â°, 2 cycles/sec) presented in a pseudorandom order
(15 repetitions) on a computer screen 15cm from the mouse for 2 seconds with a 2 second mean luminance grey
interstim period.
