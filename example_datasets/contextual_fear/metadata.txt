VGlut1-IRES2-Cre-D mice crossed to Ai162D (Jackson Laboratory: 031562 and 023527) generated double heterozygous mice
expressing GCaMP6s in pyramidal cells. A cranial window was constructed by adhering a custom-fabricate 2mm x 1.6mm BK-7
cylinder to a 3mm circular coverslip using NOA-71 optical adhesive. After postnatal day 60, a craniotomy was performed
over the dorsal hippocampus (AP: -2.0mm, ML â€“ 1.9mm). The overlying cortex was ablated using gentle suction to the
corpus callosum and the cranial window inserted. A custom titanium headplate was adhered to the cranial window and
surface of the skull using dental cement. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy was performed in the dorsal CA1 an
acquisition rate of 30.9 frames per second with a 920nm femtosecond laser (Coherent). The mouse was placed onto a
spherical treadmill with an LCD screen 15cm from the mouse. The mouse was then exposed to two audiovisual contexts in
virtual reality for seven minutes each. The two contexts were separated by an inter-trial period of darkness for seven
minutes. One context was paired with an aversive stimulus consisting of 5 air puffs (80 p.s.i., 300 ms) delivered to the
 snout at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 minutes. The following day, the mouse was again exposed to the contexts for seven minutes
 each. The example dataset was taken from this second presentation and binned into temporal segments of 200 ms.
